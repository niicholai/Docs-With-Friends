# Weekly VS Guide



## Welcome


This guide is not perfect. It's not a end-all be all. You don't have to follow it perfectly, you're not going to memorize it all immediately, and things may change in the future. This is a guide meant to get you going and have you on the best possible path currently going forward.

Special thanks to `Animality` from the `Official X-Clash Discord server` as most of the information came from his guides and videos.
